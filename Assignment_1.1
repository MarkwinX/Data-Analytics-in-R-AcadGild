1. Say True or False for the below statements:
• Prescriptive Analytics used to predict the future outcomes?
FALSE. Predictive Analytics is used to Predict the outcomes.

• Base R packages installed automatically?
No. We need to install the packages such as dplyr.

2. What is Recycling of elements in a vector?
When we have two vectors of unequal sizes and we are performing a mathematical operation between the two vectors (addition, subtraction, multiplicaton etc.),
then R automatically duplicates the elements of the smaller vector in the same order upto the length of the bigger vector and performa the mathematical
operation accordingly. In short, R 'recycles' the elements of the smaller vector in order to perform the desired mathematice opration on the 
bigger vector. This is called Recycling of Vectors.

3. Give an example of recycling of elements.
Eg. A= c(1,2,34,5)
    B= c(8,9)
    A+B= c(1,2,34,5) + c(8,9)
       = ((1+8),(2+9),(34+8),(5+9))
       =(9,11,52,14)
